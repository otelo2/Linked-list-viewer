Create a new project with a copy of the same GUI of the previous assignment, but now you will substitute "Arrays.java" with a new class called "DoubleCircularLinkedList.java" . This class will contain the attribute "head" and the methods to:

insert one element
inert from file (ordered),
eliminate,
search and
display elements of the linked list.
This linked list will consist of nodes (objects of a class you will create:  "DCNode.java" - "D" for Double, "C" for Circular) that contain one integer and two pointers, one to the next node and one to the previous node.

Submit

your programs in a .zip or .rar file together with a
Word Document with a Class Diagram and Sequence Diagram (UML) and
some explained examples of your program running, showing all possible scenarios.
